# Project purpose

For out project we chose to create a Role Playing Game, where a hero goes on a quest to collect ten ancient artefacts. The game world consists of three races (Human, Robot and Fantasoid) and each race has a couple of hero classes. Each hero has a different set of special skills and abilities, depending on his class and race. The purpose of the game is for the hero to survive until he collects all 10 artefacts. During the quest the hero also randomly collects different items (weapons, armours and special items that restore his health, weapon and armour). Every once in a while, the hero encounters an enemy and they begin to fight. During the fight, each hero uses their special skills as well as the items in their inventory. The player can encounter many enemies throughout his quest or none at all. The likelyhood is determined by a random function. After the hero has won a battle, his health regenerates as time goes by. Once all 10 artefacts have been collected, the game concludes.
